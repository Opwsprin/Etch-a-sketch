Etch-a-sketch from The Odin Project

Learned a few things frmo working on this project.

First of all, CSS grid is a tricky beast. I am sure there is a way to create a CSS grid with Javascript, but the grid-template-columns attribute seems to take as many parameters as columns you need. I did not figure out how to do this with Javascript, so I returned to the flexbox way of things, on which I had already practiced.

Secondly, I found it quite tricky to use named functions for EventListeners, specifically in cases where I would need to pass some arguments. My workaround solution was to create a nameless function then call the named function from within that.

I shamelessly copied-pasted the code for tracking whether the mouse button is pressed (not that I did not understand it, but I would not be able to code it myself).

I stayed away from the extra credit for now. My color selector is very simple and limited. I can look into more flexible color selectors that return the rgb(a) value. This will also make it easier to solve both aspects of the extra credit. I may return to this in the future.

Overall, fun project. The CSS "beautification" took me much less time than making sure the functionality was as it was supposed to be, which surprised me (I am usually better at coding than designing).

Onwards and upwards. To the next one.
